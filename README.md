# 🌾 Smart Crop Advisor

**Revolutionizing Agriculture with Machine Learning**

## 🚀 Overview

Welcome to Smart Crop Advisor, a machine learning-powered solution designed to predict the most suitable crop based on soil and environmental data. Using advanced algorithms, we analyze key factors such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), pH, Rainfall, and more to recommend one of 22 crops with optimal precision. 🌱

## 🔮 Why Choose Smart Crop Advisor?

- **Data-Driven Agriculture**: Boost yields by leveraging accurate, data-driven crop recommendations.
- **Multi-Model Analysis**: Compare top ML models to ensure peak performance.
- **Integration Ready**: Pre-trained model available via Flask API.
